What is Directives?
_________________________
Directives are instructions in DOM.
When we create a component these are one way a Directive as these are instruction to add a component to one place.
However, these are directives with Template.
There are directives without a template
Which are custom directives with @Directive decorator.

We have some predefined Directives

-> ngIf - This directive is a Structural Directive which can be used to add if we want to insert a element into the DOM
(Re writing the DOM to be precise)
