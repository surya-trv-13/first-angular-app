**** Adding a new Component ***
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
1) All components should be created inside the app folder of the Angular app.
2) Folder should be created based on the component name, (In my case Server was the component hence the folder was server).
3) In the folder a ts file should be present for which it should have a typescript class and have @Component decorator
  3.1) This Decorator has a selector property which has the component tag name to be used in the html tag
  3.2) This should have the templateUrl the html code where the html code is present for the component
4) To add the component in the Angular App it should have to be provided in the module
  4.1) This module is defined by a Decorator called NgModule.
  4.2) In Declaration property we need to add the component we want to insert for the application
  4.3) Now this Modules in the Angular used to bundle the pieces(components) of the application
  4.4) Angular will not know if the component have been added to the folder as Angular will not scan the whole project to find the component,
    > Hence we need to tell the Angular that it has this component.
5) Now once we have added the declaration of the component we can use the div tag in the html template and use it.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NgModule decorator has for properties:
  -> Declaration : Contains all the component which we need to add in the application, any component we make we need
    to make it available in the declaration of the module otherwise Angular will not know if the component is created
  -> Provider : This we will learn in coming lectures
  -> imports: This will have all the imports which required for the use in the application, like forms, http etc
  -> bootstrap: This will have the starting component of the angular app which will be triggered at the beginning.
